# grovers-algorithm-cirq
 This repository contains an implementation of **Grover's Algorithm** using **Cirq**, a quantum computing framework developed by Google. Grover's Algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that finds the unique input to a black-box function (oracle) that produces a marked output with a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms.
